Image file recovery


Restore provided damaged image file in 'JPG' format:
* 
jpeg file is damaged by reversing first forth, after that each third chunk of 1024 bytes,
* 
implemented script MUST provide two functions (recover, recover_as), 
  one of which will recover damaged image into another file specified by user (recover_as), 
  another one will recover the damaged file itself (recover),
* 
the two methods must be implemented using different file manipulation approaches,
* 
OPTIONAL: try to implement the application using OOP approaches.
